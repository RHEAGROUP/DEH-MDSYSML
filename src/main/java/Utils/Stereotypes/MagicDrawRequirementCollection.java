/**
 * The {@linkplain MagicDrawRequirementCollection} class represents a collection of {@linkplain MappedDstRequirementRowViewModel}.
 * The {@linkplain MagicDrawRequirementCollection} is usable by the {@linkplain MappingEngine} and 
 * each item of the collection represents a mapping in the {@linkplain MappingDirection.FromDstToHub}
 * 
 * The purpose of this {@linkplain MagicDrawRequirementCollection} is to type the requirements from Cameo/MagicDraw. 
 * e.g. Since the only obvious differences between Blocks and Requirements for instance are from their names and stereotypes, 
 * and there is no type difference in the MagicDraw API; they are both {@linkplain Class}.
 * 
 * Wrapping requirements this way solves the following problem,
 * The {@linkplain IMappingEngine} having to know the type of things to transform at runtime to be able to invoke the right rule; 
 * Meaning that defining a rule that takes as input a {@linkplain ArrayList} of any type isn't supported because of the java generic implementation.
