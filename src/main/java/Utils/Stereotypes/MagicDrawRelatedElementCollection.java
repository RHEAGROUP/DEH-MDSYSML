/**
 * The {@linkplain MagicDrawRelatedElementCollection} class represents a collection of{@linkplain MappedElementRowViewModel}.
 * 
 * The {@linkplain MagicDrawRelatedElementCollection} is usable by the {@linkplain MappingEngine} and 
 * each item of the collection represents a mapping in the {@linkplain MappingDirection.FromDstToHub}
 * 
 * Wrapping CapellaTracesCollection this way solves the following problem,
 * The {@linkplain IMappingEngine} having to know the type of things to transform at runtime to be able to invoke the right rule; 
 * Meaning that defining a rule that takes as input a {@linkplain ArrayList} of any type isn't supported because of the java generic implementation.
